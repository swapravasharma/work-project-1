And with the rising economic status, the overall living condition of an average human being has grown considerably within the last century, resulting in consumption of more goods and services, which has driven higher energy consumption. <br/><br/>Cities are metabolic units of energy consumption and hence an insight into urban components can give an idea regarding how to decrease the energy demand and consequently improve the energy efficiency of a city. <br/><br/>This thesis aimed to formulate strategies for implementing energy efficiency in smaller sized towns; with the case study being Bolpur, West Bengal, India.</div></div><div id="w-node-_0befc76b-828c-2822-f9fa-f2c6de040bc9-56cf4a2b"><div class="position-name-text">Study contributions</div><div class="paragraph-light cc-position-name">• Assessing the profile and status of development in Bolpur by understanding the characteristics of the city, it&#x27;s form and other relevant parameteres<br/>‍<br/>• Assessing Bolpur’s energy scenario by inspecting the sectors of energy usage, types of energy sources used, power transmission and distribution mechanism and finally the energy usage for transport requirements<br/>‍<br/>• Identifying issues and potentials existent in Bolpur related to energy including renewables augmentation, efficiency in power generation and distribution, availability of less energy intense modes of transport<br/>‍<br/>• Formulating planning strategies to achieve energy efficiency and design the implementation mechanism to bring the strategies into motion</div></div></div></div></div><div class="section"><img src="../images/2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 94vw, 95vw" srcset="../images/2-p-500.jpeg 500w, ../images/2-p-800.jpeg 800w, ../images/2-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, ../images/2.jpg 1346w" alt="" class="detail-header-image"/></div><div class="section"><div class="container"><div class="w-layout-grid project-description-grid"><div id="w-node-b915ad84-715b-fc9d-8156-ee63d52fd223-56cf4a2b"><div class="position-name-text">Analysis findings and conclusions derived</div></div><div id="w-node-b915ad84-715b-fc9d-8156-ee63d52fd22b-56cf4a2b" class="paragraph-light">Bolpur, a fairly popular tourist city in West Bengal, shows us that while it excels in certain aspects in contrast to how bigger cities perform, it also lacks in certain areas where it has higher rates of energy consumption. <br/><br/>The inner core areas of the city are fairly dense, which gives it the benefit of heat retention effect, as a result of which, heat from the surrounding areas is much less likely to be able to penetrate into the core. Consequently, less heat requires less artificial cooling, which reduces energy consumption. It also gives the added advantage of having highly accessible neighborhoods, where one can move within the city using active transport. Most of the people here have their own bicycles and motorcycles which they use for transport purposes. <br/><br/>Water bodies are also fairly abundant and uniformly distributed all over the city, making it easy for evapotranspiration to take place and effectively decrease the average summer temperatures and henceforth reducing the energy consumption due to artificial cooling mechanisms. <br/><br/>Although artificial cooling with the help of electricity is always high in demand, one hurdle that many small cities in India face today, Bolpur being no exception, is the lack of 100% coverage of electricity. Even though, electricity generation is not entirely a 100% efficient process yet, there is no doubt that electricity is still the most efficient medium of utilization of energy.<br/><br/>Bolpur, although it lacks any solar power generation measures, has an applaudable target of powering all government buildings through solar panels within a decade. This is something, all smaller sized cities can ideally replicate, as solar power generation has a very low barrier in terms of infrastructure requirements, in comparison to other popular renewable sources of electricity. <br/><br/>Bolpur also has the added benefit of being in the vicinity of an area with high geo-thermal potential. While the infrastructure cost of a geo-thermal power generation system is high, it is a worthy long-term investment.<br/><br/>While this might realistically require co-operation from multiple cities to implement in practice, a district cooling system is something that any city can install and benefit from, particularly ones with clustered commercial or institutional zones. It can cut down the commercial and institutional cooling load by 50%. In the case of Bolpur, there are two energy intensive locations which can make use of this system, to save energy. <br/><br/>In addition to the above, Bolpur can also immensely benefit from replacing its 100% HPSV street lamps infrastructure with LED street lamps, as they can cut down on street lamp energy requirements by half. <br/><br/>Finally, to make sure that amidst the efficient generation and consumption of electricity, the distribution is also efficient, smart metering can also be implemented, wherever possible, as it prevents T&amp;D losses. Since small cities have smaller population, the installation cost of smart meters tends to be comparatively lower and can be a great investment to monitor electricity usage and hence improve energy efficiency of the city.</div></div></div></div><div class="section"><img src="../images/3.jpg" width="920" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 94vw, 95vw" srcset="../images/3-p-500.jpeg 500w, ../images/3-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, ../images/3.jpg 1200w" alt="" class="detail-image"/><img src="../images/4.jpg" width="920" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 94vw, 95vw" srcset="../images/4-p-500.jpeg 500w, ../images/4-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, ../images/4.jpg 1200w" alt="" class="detail-image"/><img src="../images/5.jpg" width="920" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 94vw, 95vw" srcset="../images/5-p-500.jpeg 500w, ../images/5-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, ../images/5.jpg 1200w" alt="" class="detail-image"/><div class="text-block">If you&#x27;d like to see this project in more detail, drop me a mail for the research article pdf.</div></div><div class="section"><div class="container"><div class="email-section"><p>If you like what you see, get in touch!</p><a href="mailto:jane@portfolio.com?subject=You&#x27;ve%20got%20mail!" class="email-link">swaprava.s@pm.me</a></div></div></div><div class="footer-wrap"><div class="div-block"><h6 class="heading-2">© Swaprava Sharma.
